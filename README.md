In this page I used ASP.NET MVC framework and C#. In order to design, I used HTML,CSS, Javascript.
To make a better design, I attached bootstrap and jquery libraries into this project.

There are many options you can use,

- Categories 
- Products
- Customers
- Sales

with these options, you can add a new category, product,customer and sale and their properties.

You can also update and delete these options.

and some more options...
